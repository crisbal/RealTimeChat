#Real Time Chat

(Septemper 2015: Dead Project, I made this a long time ago to learn Socket.io, I am sharing it now because I just found it hidden somewhere in my PC)

A simple and easy to use chat written in Node + Socket.io

Supports custom emoticons (edit/add them in app.js)

I used to run this on an Heroku instance.
